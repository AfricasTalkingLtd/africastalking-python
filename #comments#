research pep8 for the imports and cleaning up the code.
python imports
custom imports
then the others.

put the things iin an .env
remove the home route

anticipate the errors using the try catch statements
consistency with the caps(Probably camel case)

import flake

clean up the markups
move the styling to the style file

communicate to the template that either there was success or an error
render the home template when it is successful.. just don't send them back home



pass in the callbback function
