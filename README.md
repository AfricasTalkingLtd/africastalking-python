![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/africastalking.svg)

> The SDK provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking APIs to python apps.


## Documentation
Take a look at the [API docs here](https://build.at-labs.io/discover/).

## Install

```bash
$ pip  install africastalking # python 2.7.x

OR

$ python -m pip install africastalking # python 2.7.x

OR

$ pip3 install africastalking # python 3.6.x

OR

$ python3 -m pip install africastalking # python 3.6.x

```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your app username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://account.africastalking.com/).

> You can use this SDK for either production or sandbox apps. For sandbox, the app username is **ALWAYS** `sandbox`

```python
# import package
import africastalking


# Initialize SDK
username = "YOUR_USERNAME"    # use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"      # use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
africastalking.initialize(username, api_key)


# Initialize a service e.g. SMS
sms = africastalking.SMS


# Use the service synchronously
response = sms.send("Hello Message!", ["+2547xxxxxx"])
print(response)

# Or use it asynchronously
def on_finish(error, response):
    if error is not None:
        raise error
    print(response)

sms.send("Hello Message!", ["+2547xxxxxx"], callback=on_finish)    

```

See [example](example/) for more usage examples.
